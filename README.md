[Deployed App](https://brachio.herokuapp.com/)  

## Features / Functionality

### Account
Users are able to create an account.
### Listings
Registered users are able to create listings. Listings also have an option to upload a photo, which will get saved to Cloudinary.
### Search
Search functionality lets users to search for a paticular listing. It is possible to search by title, postcode or category.
### Online payment using Stripe
This app is more of a meet and greet type of marketplace so I feel like it actually does not need a payment system. I decided to build one just to practice. At this moment, it enables user to pay for one item at a time. When item is bought, available qty for the listing gets decreased by one. 
### Ratings
Users are able to rate each other, to leave feedback either on sellers or buyers. 
### Chat
Users are able to message each other to enquire about listings or just to connect
